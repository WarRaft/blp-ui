# Icon

```
/i Dark aggressive icon: a sharp-edged skull with hollow eyes and nose, giving two thumbs up. Angular, menacing features, cracked bone texture, sharp teeth, grim expression. Eyes glow with eerie red light, faint smoke or haze rising. Bold black outlines, high contrast, subtle gray shading for depth. Aggressive, cursed vibe, not cartoonish. Black background with thick white outline around the whole design, strong sticker/icon style. Optimized for small-scale use, dark gothic energy.

# Logo

```
/i -s Telegram sticker design: the bold text "BLP-RS" dominates the center on a torn, blood-stained banner, carved like cracked metal glowing faintly from within. Behind it, a fierce pirate skull with both thumbs up in a tattered tricorn hat, framed by cracked ship wheels and frayed ropes. White skull with deep shadows, broken teeth, and glowing eyes with smoke. Accents: crimson red, muted cyan, steel blue, metallic gold. Dark, high-contrast Warcraft-style shading, cursed pirate energy. Black background with thick white outline, iconic sticker look.

/i -h Sticker-style dark fantasy seamless pattern background: pirate and cursed motifs (skulls in shredded tricorn hats, jagged cutlasses, cracked ship wheels, frayed ropes, torn sails, glowing runes, misty orbs, sparks, flames) arranged in radial symmetry. Larger elements near the center, gradually smaller outward, forming a dense repeating mandala-like pattern. No single logo or text, just evenly filled background. Flat bold shapes, sharp edges, thick white outlines, high contrast. Dark base with bone white, crimson red, muted cyan, steel blue, metallic gold, and fiery orange accents. Aggressive, ominous, iconic look. Optimized for OpenGraph repository background.
